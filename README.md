# Proximity Server
Proximity Server provides a back-end REST endpoint for the Proximity application.  See https://github.com/Chris-Perkins/Proximity on what the application does.  
## How it works
Proximity Server was written in Python and connects to MongoDB database.  Flask was utilized to provide the REST endpoints, and GUnicorn helped with providing ease of traffic for Flask.
## Current Deployment
A current instance of it is running on Heroku with a MongoDB running on mLabs.
